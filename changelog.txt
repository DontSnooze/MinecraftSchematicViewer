Schematic Viewer is an app that helps with building Minecraft structures. 

View schematics by layer and get block counts. No guessing about what block is behind/under/not visible. 

Please try out the clip board button to test out the level viewer.

If you have a .schem file downloaded please try the import file button.

Try the charts button to get block counts of displayed levels.

Transparent cyan colored blocks mean those blocks are in progress of being added but feel free to let me know about them.

Let me know if anything is off and lookout for updates!

Thank you!
